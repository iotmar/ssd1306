# ESP32 ONBOARD SSD1306 OLED Display Driver Support

This library is a changed version to support the ESP32 boards with a onboard oled display and the following configuration:

SDA = pin 4, SCL = pin 15, RESET = pin 16

SSD1306 display 0x3c, 4, 15

It's the Le Xin ESP32, Tensilica LX6 dual core processor you find on AliExpress etc. 
Since info on this is scare and it took me hours to get it working, I decided to put this changed library out,
so I never have to look it up again and use it over and over again and so can you :-)
